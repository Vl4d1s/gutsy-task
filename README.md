A competitive tournament with multiple participants has just finished - the results are available.
The task is to build a single-page application that displays the tournament's results.


## Decisions and Assumptions:
* Project Generation - I generate the project using the Vite React/Typescript template.
* UI Design - I decided to design the application using MUI.
* Proxy Settings:
